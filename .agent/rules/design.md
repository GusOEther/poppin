# Workspace Rules: Rich Aesthetics (Mobile First)

- Framework: **React Native** & **Expo**.
- All UI components must follow modern Web and Mobile Design standards.
- Use vibrant colors, dark modes, glassmorphism, and dynamic animations.
- Prioritize visual excellence: use premium typography (Google Fonts), smooth gradients, and micro-animations.
- Optimize for touch interactions and mobile responsiveness.
- Use libraries like 'react-native-reanimated' for smooth transitions.
